## What is this? tl:dr;

You ask the compass,
"How am I going to die?"
It answers, "🦉🍞."

Project Analogy: It's like an emoji Magic 8 ball for people who read the His Dark Materials trilogy

### What is this? for people who like words

The Dark Materials trilogy is centered around a "Golden Compass". Its official name is alethiometer, or "truth measure". The device is like a compass, in that it's the size of a pocketwatch and has needles that spin toward answers. Its face shows 36 symbols, each of which can represent 12+ ideas, concepts, or literal meanings. 

To use the compass, the user sets the three needles to three symbols that frame the question she is posing, and then the alethiometer spins the needles to three symbols to provide a cryptic answer. This answer is truth, but must be carefully interpreted. 

The Bad Idea Factory has created a mobile app that replaces the 36 alethiometer symbols with emoji. The answers the app returns are appropriately shrouded in the symbology of the novels.
